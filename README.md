## What is TzeBot?
TzeBot, is a discord bot project that I've started about 6th month of 2020. The reasons that I started to develop TzeBot were:
1. There was not a such discord bot substructure that runs properly at all. Some of them were broken completely, some of them were just worked terribly.
2. There was not a such discord bot substructure that whose has working GUI or good manual that describes you how can you host your own bot on it.

Then I just wonder why was I not developing a really good one to publish it for free to use. All of the story of TzeBot just came out like this.

## How can I use it?
### a) Just invite TzeBot to your server
First of all, you have to have "**manage server**" permission of the server that you want to invite TzeBot. Then, <a href="https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=700416851678855168&scope=bot&permissions=1379216720">**just click on this line to open invite link**</a> and select the server that you want to invite TzeBot, do not change the permissions of TzeBot if you want to use all of the features of it, that's it. Now you can use TzeBot in your discord server don't worry it's online 24/7.

When it came your server first time, it's prefix will be "**.**" and it's language will be "**English**". You can change it's language and prefix if you want to, before that shall we just look at the commands of TzeBot? Type "**.help**":

As you can see, all of the commands are categorized, if you want to look at the all moderation commands and their explanations just type "**.help moderation**":

If you want to look at music commands of TzeBot, just type "**.help music**":

If you aim to use TzeBot as a music bot that you might have been noticed "**.channel**" command. You can use TzeBot as a normal music bot by writing each command "**.play**", "**.skip**", "**.volume**"... Or you can just setup your music channel to feel the difference and convenience of TzeBot. Type "**.channel create**":

Then all you have to do is just go to the created music channel and type "**.channel set**":

After you wrote "**.channel set**" into the music channel you will have been noticed that your message is deleted and 2 messages added into music channel. First one is banner of TzeBot, the other one is the reaction-control panel or at least the name that I put into it. It allows you to control music player with emotes. And all the functions of the emotes is above of themselves. You can just type name of the song or URL of the song that you want to play into channel.

### b) Use TzeBot as a substructure of your bot

Just download the latest version of TzeBot <a href="https://github.com/Tzesh/TzeBot/releases">**in this link**</a>. And extract TzeBot-x.x.rar to a directory then open TzeBot-x.x.jar. If you want to use TzeBot as a substructure of your bot, you'll need 3 things that have to be filled:

![GUI](https://tzesh.github.io/TzeBot/img/GUI.PNG)

1. Discord ID of Owner: Just enable developer mode in Discord and then just message an arbitrary channel and then right click on yourself then "Copy ID".
2. Discord Bot Token: You propably have it already, if you don't just search in google "how to create discord bot in discord developer portal?".
3. Youtube API Key: Just follow the instructions <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started">in this page</a>.

Now you are ready to go. Just hit start button to make your bot online.

#### Features of TzeBot substructure
* Automatic saving-loading: Don't worry about losing datas of your servers. All of the database is saving per 15 minutes and also on close and loading every start.
* Version control: If you are encountering some problems when using TzeBot substructure, just give us a feedback and then wait for a new version. In every start TzeBot will check if there is an update or not.
* Sharding: This is a feature that allows you to use your bot too many of servers. 1 shard unofficially equals about 1500 server load.
